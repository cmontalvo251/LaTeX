\section{Changes Needed}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-5pt]
\item For the pendulum assignment make a note that the pendulum cannot spin or you won't get good data
\item Add homework problems from the instrumentation textbook into the projects here. 
\item Create circuit diagrams for each lesson.
\item More theory is needed in this book or direction to further
  reading for the students. Like a lesson on how each sensor works. The thermistor, photocell and pitot probe come to mind
\item The photo of the button lab could be better (i.e add labels to
  each item)
\item The circuit photo for the LSM6DS33 is not correct
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Project Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-5pt]
\item PhotoInterrupter Lab (Angular Velocity) - 3D print a disc with holes on the outside to eventually mount to a rotating shaft  
\item Load Cell Calibration Lab - load cells with the HMC converter
\item Environmental Labs - (1) Take temperature and light data on a cloudy day. Then have them infer if the amount of sunlight affected the temperature of the thermistor. They could plot the data with light on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis and draw conclusions based on the plot they generate. (2) Take temperature and light data over the course of a whole day and draw similar conclusions
\end{enumerate}
