\section{Changes Needed}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-5pt]
\item Add a saturation filter so that your regression equation doesn't output a pulse outside of your min and max - servo assignment
\item Add homework problems from the instrumentation textbook into the projects here. 
\item Create circuit diagrams for each lesson.
\item Double check that OBS is not listed anywhere and rather something to the effect of "must show face and code" or "must record yourself and screen" or "must use webcam and record screen"
\item More theory is needed in this book or direction to further
  reading for the students
\item For the pendulum assignment make a note that the pendulum cannot spin or you won't get good data
\item Create a lesson on how each sensor works. The thermistor and pitot probe come to mind 
\item The photo of the button lab could be better (i.e add labels to
  each item)
\item The circuit photo for the LSM6DS33 is not correct
\item Equations on thermistor need to be expanded
\item Equations relating voltage from photocell to Lux needs to be included
\item Example plots for light, sound, acceleration, etc needs to be expanded
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Project Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-5pt]
\item PhotoInterrupter Lab (Angular Velocity) - 3D print a disc with holes on the outside to eventually mount to a rotating shaft  
\item Load Cell Calibration Lab - load cells with the HMC converter
\item Environmental Labs - (1) Take temperature and light data on a cloudy day. Then have them infer if the amount of sunlight affected the temperature of the thermistor. They could plot the data with light on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis and draw conclusions based on the plot they generate. (2) Take temperature and light data over the course of a whole day and draw similar conclusions
\end{enumerate}
