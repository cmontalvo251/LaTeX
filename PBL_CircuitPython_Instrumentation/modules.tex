If you need extra help on this assignment I have uploaded a youtube
video where I \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceI0uw3ICE0}{read
the temperature and accelerometer from the CircuitPlayground
Bluefruit} 

\subsection{Getting Started}

The CPX has numerous built-in sensors. These include a light sensor,
an IR sensor, an accelerometer, a microphone, a speaker, some
neopixels, a temperature sensor and 8 analog inputs with ADCs and even
I2C (pronounced I squared C - it’s a kind of serial communication)
that you can use to easily hook up more sensors to it. We're not going
to utilize all of these sensors since that would be a rather large
project. Instead we’re going to learn how to use the temperature,
light and sound sensors as well as the accelerometer. For each of
these examples there is a relatively easy way to access the sensors
using a built-in module called {\it
adafruit\_circuitplayground.express} if you are using the CPX. If you
are using the CPB you need to type {\it
adafruit\_circuitplayground.bluefruit}. It’s a very nice module
because it imports everything on the board. The problem is you can run
into module conflicts. This happens when two different modules try to
access the same pins on the CP. Sometimes if you import {\it
adafruit\_circuitplayground} you won’t be able to import some other
modules. {\bf Note you might need to add the {\it
adafruit\_circuitplayground} library to your lib/ folder on your
CIRCUITPY drive}. Due to this module conflict issue, there are some
low level control commands you can use to access each of the sensors
on board. We're obviously going to learn the low level control method
first and then I’ll show you how to access the sensors using the {\it
adafruit\_circuitplayground} module. {\bf If you get a “currently in
use” error it means you have a module conflict. Hence why I’m showing
you the low level control method}. \input{module_install}

\subsection{Low Level Control}

\subsubsection{Light}

The light sensor on the CPX is just a simple photocell wired in series
with a resistor. There is a lab on photocells (See
chapter \ref{s:photocell} if you'd like to do that lab first to learn
about photocells. The GND leg of the photocell is connected to pin
A8. You can check the pin by looking at the graphic of an eye on the
CPX and taking a look at the digital pin next to it. We’ve already
learned how to {access analog pins (See chapter \ref{s:voltage}) in a
previous lab so just use
the \href{https://github.com/cmontalvo251/Microcontrollers/blob/master/Circuit_Playground/CircuitPython/Analog/analog_simple.py}{code
from that lab} and change the pin to A8. Here’s what my code looks
like when I change the pin to A8. I also brought the Plotter up and
moved my finger in front of the light to make sure the light was
working. Verify that your CPX responds the same way before moving on. 
\begin{figure}[H]

  \end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Sound}
The sound sensor uses the audiobusio library and creates a mic object
using the (Pulse Density Modulation) PDM library. You have to set the
sample rate and the number of bits to use to capture the data. We’re
going to set the bits to 16 to utilize the whole spectrum and then set
the sample rate to 16 kHz. It’s not quite 44.1 kHz like most modern
microphones but it will do. After creating the mic object we have to
compute some root mean squared values and thus two functions are
defined before the while true loop in the code. The code itself is
shown below. The code starts on line 22 because the
first \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pdm-microphone-breakout/circuitpython}{22
lines are copyright from Dan Halbert, Kattni Rembor, and Tony DiCola
from Adafruit Industries}. I have edited the code a bit to fit my
needs and
uploaded \href{https://github.com/cmontalvo251/Microcontrollers/blob/master/Circuit_Playground/CircuitPython/Audio/record_sound_simple.py}{my
version to Github}. In the code line 23-27 import standard modules as
well as some new ones. The array module is used to create array like
matrices. The math module is used to compute functions like cos, sin,
and sqrt. Then of course the audiobusio module is used to create the
mic object on line 42. Notice the two functions defined on 33 and 39
which create a function for computing the mean and for computing the
normalized root mean square value of the data stream. Basically what’s
going to happen is we’re going to record 160 samples as defined on
line 160. So on line 43 we create a hexadecimal array (hexademical:
base 16 hence the num\_bits set to 16 on line 31) with 160 zeros. In
the while true loop we’re going to sleep for 0.01 seconds and then
record some samples. Since we’re sampling at 16 kHz the time it takes
to record 160 samples is 160/16000 = 16/1600 = 1/100 = 0.01
seconds. Since we’re taking 160 samples we need to compute some sort
of average which is why the normalized root mean square value is
computed on line 48. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/sound_code.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
When I run this code and talk normally into the microphone. I get this
output in the Plotter. You’ll notice that the data is pretty noisy in
the beginning. It’s possible we could increase the number of samples
we take each loop by editing line 30 but that would slow down our
code. So there’s a tradeoff between filtering here and speed. That’s
something will investigate in some later labs. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/sound_mu.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Temperature}
The temperature sensor is actually
a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor}{thermistor}. A
thermistor is basically a thermometer resistor which means the
resistance depends on temperature. This means that you can read the
analog signal coming from the thermistor just by reading the analog
signal from pin A9. If you look for the thermometer symbol on the CPX
you’ll see pin A9. Therefore, it is possible to just use the analogio
library and just read in the analog voltage but in order to convert to
celsius and then fahrenheit you need to use some heat transfer
equations to convert the analog signal to celsius. Thankfully the
folks at Adafruit have done it again with an {\it
adafruit\_thermistor} module. If you head over to
their \href{https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Thermistor/blob/master/adafruit_thermistor.py}{github
on this module} you’ll see the relevant conversion under the
definition temperature which at the time of this writing is on line
86. \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/circuitpython}{The
Adafruit Learn system also does a bit of work to explain the
conversion from voltage to temperature}. For now though we will just
appreciate the simplicity of the code below which is
also \href{https://github.com/cmontalvo251/Microcontrollers/blob/master/Circuit_Playground/CircuitPython/Temp/record_temperature_thermistor.py}{on
my Github}. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/thermistor_code.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
As always lines 1-3 import the relevant modules and then line 8 create
the thermistor object. You’ll notice the input arguments are the pin
which is A9 as well as the resistor values which are in series with
the thermistor. These resistors are soldered to the PCB so they are
fixed at 10 kOhms. The 25 is for the nominal resistance temperature in
celsius of the thermistor and 3950 is the b coefficient which is a
heat transfer property. Running this code and then placing my finger
on the A9 symbol causes the temperature to rise just a bit. You’ll
notice the temperature rise quite quickly when I place my finger on
the sensor but when I remove the sensor it takes some time before the
sensor cools off. This has to do with the dynamic response of the
sensor. We’ll discuss this in some future labs on dynamic
measurements. For now you can move on to the accelerometer. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/thermistor_mu.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Accelerometer}
\label{s:modules}
The accelerometer is a 3-axis sensor. As such it is going to spit out
not just 1 value but 3 values. Accelerations in x,y and z or North,
East, Down or Forward, Side to Side, Up and Down. Since it’s reading 3
values we can’t just read 3 analog signals (we can but the
accelerometer chip design didn’t want to do that) so instead we’re
going to use the I2C (I like indigo and square C. So I squared C. Not
12C or one two C. It’s I squared C) functionality. I2C is a type of
serial communication that allows computers to send strings rather than
numbers. It’s a much more complex form of communication but since it’s
standard we can just use the busio module which contains the I2C
protocol. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/accelerometer_code.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
In this code we see alot more imports than normal. In addition to the
standard time, board and digitalio modules we need the busio module
and the {\it adafruit\_lis3dh}. You might think that LIS3DH is a very
weird name for an accelerometer but it’s actually the name of the chip
on your CPX. The chip itself is very standard and is well documented
on multiple
websites. \href{https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lis3dh.html}{Here’s
one from ST}. You can also buy
the \href{https://www.adafruit.com/product/2809?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI98qfjrC86gIVEI_ICh2JtQ-JEAAYAiAAEgJ2_fD_BwE}{chip
on a breakout board from Adafruit} and then of course the Adafruit
Learn site has plenty of tutorials
on \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-hardware-lis3dh-accelerometer/software}{reading
Accelerometer data in CircuitPython}. As always I’ve learned what I
can from the relevant tutorials and
created \href{https://github.com/cmontalvo251/Microcontrollers/blob/master/Circuit_Playground/CircuitPython/Accelerometer/low_level_accel.py}{my
own simple version to read the accelerometer data and posted it to
Github}. I digress, lines 8-11 of the code do alot. It first uses the
SCL and SDA pins to set up an I2C object which establishes serial
communication to the accelerometer. Line 9 creates an interrupt which
is beyond the scope of this course. Finally, line 10 creates the
actual accelerometer object by sending it the I2C pins, the
hexadecimal address in the I2C protocol and finally the interrupt
pin. Line 11 then sets the range. Line 14 in the while loop is where
the x,y and z values of the accelerometer are read and then promptly
printed to Serial on line 15. If I run this code and shake the sensor
a bit I can get all the values to vary. If you put the CPX on a flat
surface, the Z axis will measure something close to 9.81. The units of
the accelerometer are clearly in $m/s^2$.

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/accelerometer_mu.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{High Level Control}

Alright so we’ve learned the hard way for all the sensors using low
level control of the various sensors. Let’s now import the simple
adafruit\_circuitplayground.express
module. \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-made-easy-on-circuit-playground-express/circuit-playground-express-library}{The
Adafruit Learn site offers pretty much every example code snippet
you’d ever need for all the different push buttons and sensors on the
CPX}. Head over there if you ever need something outside of the scope
of this text. As I said before, the main module you need to import is
done by adding the following to the top of your code 
\begin{verbatim}
from adafruit_circuitplayground.express import cpx
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Note that you need to change that line to adafruit\_circuitplayground.bluefruit import cpb. Then everywhere you see cpx you replace with cpb.}
This will import the cpx module into your working code. From here the
commands to read different things are relatively simple. Here are the
commands for all the various sensors 
\begin{verbatim}
light = cpx.light

x,y,z = cpx.acceleration

temperature = cpx.temperature
\end{verbatim}

There unfortunately is no simple module for the sound sensor. You’ll
still need to use the low level control no matter what. According to
Adafruit though, if you get the Circuit Playground Bluefruit there is
a \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-made-easy-on-circuit-playground-express/sound}{simple
way to read the sound level}. Implementing the various sensors into a
while loop on my CPX looks like this. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/high_level_mu.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
I left out the sound sensor stuff just because it kind of messes with
the simplicity of the code above. The
adafruit\_circuitplayground.express module outputs just as before
except for the light sensor. In the low level control we simply
computed the voltage across the photocell but the
adafruit\_circuitplayground.express module outputs data
in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux}{Lux}. 

\subsection{Assignment}

Using either {\bf low or high level control} take at least 60 seconds
of data for each of the sensors above. Make sure log time and the raw
sensor value at 1Hz or faster. To make the project more challenging,
try and log all sensor data all at once. Import the data onto your
desktop and make 4 plots total with time on the x-axis and the sensor
data on the y-axis.
