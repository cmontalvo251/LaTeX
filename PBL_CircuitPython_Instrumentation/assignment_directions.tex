Once you've completed the project above, upload a PDF with all of the photos and text
below included. My recommendation is for you to create a Word document
and insert all the photos and text into the document. Then export the
Word document to a PDF. For videos I suggest uploading the videos to
Google Drive, turn on link sharing and include a link in your PDF.
