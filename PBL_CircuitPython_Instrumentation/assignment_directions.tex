\noindent For every project you must turn in a formal properly formatted engineering report submitted as a PDF. The grading rubric is shown below.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-5pt]
\item The first page will be a title page with your name, title of the project and date - Pass/Fail 	
\item The second page will contain an introduction which explains the project, learning objectives and expected outcomes - 10\%
\item After the introduction you then include the project specific requirements (see below) - 80\%
\item All figures must have appropriate figure captions, axis labels and a paragraph explaining the figure - 10\%
\item The last few pages will be appendices which are pass/fail. Failure to include both Appendix "A" and "B" will result in a zero in the assignment. Appendix "A" will be a link (Youtube or Google Drive) to a professional video recording of you and your screen explaining the project and showing any of the systems operate as asked. Appendix "B" will be any and all code used in the project - Pass/Fail
