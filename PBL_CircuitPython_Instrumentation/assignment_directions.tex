\noindent {\large {\bf Grading Rubric}}
\ \\
\ \\
\noindent For every project you must turn in a properly formatted engineering report submitted as a PDF. The grading rubric is shown below.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-5pt]
\item The first page will be a title page with your name, title of the project and date - Pass/Fail 	
\item The second page will contain an introduction which explains the
project itself, learning objectives and expected outcomes - 10\%
\item After the introduction you then include the project specific requirements (see below) - 80\%
\item All figures must have appropriate figure captions, axis labels and a paragraph explaining the figure - 10\%
\item The last few pages will be appendices which are
pass/fail. Failure to include both Appendix "A" and "B" will result in
a zero in the assignment. Appendix "A" will be a link (Youtube or
Google Drive) to a professional video recording of you and your screen
explaining the project and showing any of the systems operate as
asked. {\bf This includes any portion of the experiment such as
heating up your thermistor or rotating a potentiometer and showing the
response in the Serial monitor}. Appendix "B" will be any and all code
used in the project - {\bf Failure to provide code or an adequate video
results in a failure of the assignment.}
