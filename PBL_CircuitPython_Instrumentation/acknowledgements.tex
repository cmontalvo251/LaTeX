\section{Acknowledgements}

The author, Dr. Carlos Montalvo would like to acknowledge a few key
members who made this textbook possible. First and foremost I would
like to thank Adafruit for their entire ecosystem of electronics,
tutorials, blogs and forums. Much of what I have learned here to teach
Instrumentation was from \href{https://www.adafruit.com/}{Adafruit}
and the \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/}{Adafruit Learn} system and 
specifically people like Lady Ada and John Park who have helped shape
\href{https://circuitpython.org/}{CircuitPython} and the
\href{https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333}{CircuitPlayground
  Express} to what it is today. I 
would also like to thank Dr. Saami Yazdani for creating the blueprint
for Instrumentation at my university by creating a laboratory
environment for an otherwise totally theoretical course. His course
was the foundation for this textbook and for that I thank him for
showing the way. Iâ€™d like to also thank and acknowledge Tangibles that
Teach for giving me the opportunity to morph this loose set of
projects into a textbook that can be used for multiple universities
and classrooms and of course help students learn and acquire knowledge
through creating.
