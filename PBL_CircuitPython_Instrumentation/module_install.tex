\subsection{Installing Modules}

{\bf One issue you're going to run into when
you run the codes below is that you won't have some of the modules on
your CPB/CPX.} To fix this you need to download
the \href{https://circuitpython.org/libraries}{CircuitPython
Libraries}. You need to download the appropriate
version: 6.x, 7.x or 8.x. How do you know what version of CircuitPython
you have? Well head over to your CIRCUITPY drive and open the
boot\_out.txt file and it will tell you the version. Note that this is
the same version as the .UF2 file installed back in the Getting
Started labs (See Chapter \ref{s:Getting_Started}). When you download
the modules it will download a .zip file. Extract the .zip file on
your desktop computer and then open the {\it lib} folder on your
desktop and your CIRCUITPY. You then need to transfer the modules
(ONLY THE ONES YOU NEED) from your desktop to your CPX/CPB {\it lib} folder. The reason
why you can't copy the entire folder is because the CPB/CPX only has
2MB of flash and the CircuitPython download is 4.1 MB at the time of
this writing.
