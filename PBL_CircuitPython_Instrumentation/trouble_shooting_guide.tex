\section{Troubleshooting Guide}

{\bf Is your CPX/CPB broken or not running code? Read below.}

Now this is really important. Your CPX is a USB stick that can hold as
many Python files as 2MB will allow but it can only run or execute one
python script at a time. Furthermore it will only run two types of
files. It will run code.py if it exists and if it can't find code.py
it will run main.py If the CPX can't find main.py or code.py it will
just not do anything. If you have two versions of main.py or a
combination of main.py or code.py it will run one of them and not the
other. Make sure you only have one version of main.py or code.by but
not both! Some common things to check if your CPX isn't working.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-5pt]
  \item Make sure you're using Mu in the right Mode
  \item Make sure main.py or code.py is on the CIRCUITPY drive and not somewhere on your computer.
  \item Make sure you are editing the right file in Mu. Do you have two versions of main.py?
  \item Are you editing using Thonny or Spyder?
  \item Are you editing a file on your computer? Make sure you are
    writing to the CIRCUITPY drive.
  \item Do you have the right modules in your {\it lib} folder?
  \item Unplug the CPX, close Mu and try again.
  \item What if my CIRCUITPY drive doesn’t work anymore
  \item First, try and reset the CPX to CPLAYBOOT and reflash the UF2 to see if that fixes it.
  \item If you have a linux computer you can ``sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0" and then run ``storage.erase\_filesystem()"
  \item If that doesn’t work sometimes you just need to completely erase the CIRCUITPY drive so head over to this \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/troubleshooting}{troubleshooting guide} and follow some of the steps they tell you.
  \item As a last resort you can try to download these UF2s and
    hopefully it will fix all errors and mistakes -

  \item If you're having an issue with an old bootloader be sure to update the \href{https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/update-bootloader-use-command-line}{bootloader}.
