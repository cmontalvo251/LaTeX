'Structure functions for the 3D-Var assimilation scheme of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are evaluated from statistics of the differences between two forecasts valid at the same time. Results compare satisfactorily with those reported in the existing literature. Non-separability of the correlation functions is a pervasive feature. Accounting for non-separability in 3D-Var is necessary to reproduce geostrophic characteristics of the statistics, such as the increase of length-scale with height for the horizontal correlation of the mass variable, sharper vertical correlations for wind than for mass and shorter horizontal length-scales for temperature than for mass. In our non-separable 3D-Var, the vertical correlations vary with total wave-number and the horizontal correlation functions vary with vertical level.','1998','empty','empty','124','Rabier F., McNally A., Andersson E., Courtier P., Unden P., Eyre J., Hollingsworth A., Bouttier F.,','empty','Papers/3Dvar/98QJ-Rabier-ECMWF3Dvar.pdf','1809-1829','Q.

'The construction of a building inevitably changes the microclimate in its vicinity. In particular near high-rise buildings, high wind velocities are often introduced at pedestrian level that can be experienced as uncomfortable or even dangerous. Therefore, the design of a building should not only focus on the building envelope and on providing good indoor environment, but should also include the effect of the design on the outdoor environment. The outdoor environment of a building, in particular related to wind, has received relatively little attention in the Building Physics community. The present paper addresses Building Physicists and focuses on the outdoor wind environment for pedestrians. First, a litera- ture review on pedestrian wind studies is provided. The relation between wind effects, wind comfort, wind danger and wind climate is outlined. A brief review on wind tunnel and numerical modeling of building aerodynamics and pedestrian wind is given. The typical wind flow pattern around buildings and the related wind environment at pedestrian level are discussed. Second, these problems are illustrated by means of four practical examples, where the unfavorable pedestrian wind environment has been, is or should be a matter of serious concern for the building designers and the building owner.','2004','2','October','28','B.

'This paper is focused on numerical investigation of subsonic flow separation over a NACA0012 airfoil with a 6 degree angle of attack and flow separation control with vortex generators. The numerical simulations of three cases including an uncontrolled baseline case, a controlled case with passive vortex generator, and a controlled case with active vortex generator were carried out. The numerical simulation solves the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations for compressible flow using a fully implicit LUSGS method. A fourth order finite difference scheme is used to compute the spatial derivatives. The immersed boundary method is used to model both the passive and active vortex generators. The characteristic frequency that dominates the flow is the natural frequency of separation in the baseline case. The introduction of the passive vortex generator does not alter the frequency of separation. In the case with active control, the frequency of the sinusoidal forcing was chosen close to the natural frequency of separation. The time and spanwise averaged results were used to examine the mean flow field for all three cases. The passive vortex generators can partially eliminate the separation by reattaching the separated shear layer to the airfoil over a significant extent. The size of the averaged separation zone has been reduced by more than 80. The flow control with active vortex generator is more effective and the separation zone is not visible in the averaged results. The three dimensional structures of the flow field have also been studied.This paper is focused on numerical investigation of subsonic flow separation over a NACA0012 airfoil with a 6 degree angle of attack and flow separation control with vortex generators.

'A numerical investigation of active flow control, which can offer significant improvements to aircraft wing, helicopter and wind-turbine rotor performance by suppressing detrimental effects of separated flow, is presented. Numerical simulations of pulsating jet flow control applied on airfoils and wings at low speed, high Reynolds number turbulent flow and fixed angles of incidence are carried out. Pulsating jet active flow control is applied as a surface boundary condition and the flow is time-dependent. It was found that fine grid resolution is required to capture the pulsating jet and its interaction with the boundary layer. Efficient, implicit, time-accurate numerical methods for unsteady RANS of incompressible flow are used to overcome the stringent stability limitations imposed by small grid spacing. A widely tested one-equation turbulence model is used for the prediction of the complex, unsteady flowfields. It is found that active flow control can enhance aerodynamic performance by reducing the adverse effects of separated flow. The effect of pulsation frequency, and jet exit velocity on flow control is investigated.','2004','empty','March','8','Ekaterinaris J.','active flow control, bleed air control, separation control, airfoil','Papers/Bleed_Air_Control/1-s2.0-S1270963804000148-main.pdf','401-410','ScienceDirect Aerospace Science and Technology','Prediction of active flow control performance on airfoils and winds','Ekaterinaris2004','article','57',
'The interaction between a conventional rectangular (primary) air jet and a co-flowing synthetic jet is investigated experimentally. The nozzles of both jets have the same long dimension but the aspect ratio of the synthetic jet orifice is 25 times larger. Detailed particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the flow in the midspan plane show that primary jet fluid is directed into the synthetic jet orifice and the interaction between the jets leads to the formation of a closed recirculating flow domain. The concomitant formation of a low-pressure region between the jets results in deflection of the primary jet toward the actuator jet despite the absence of an extended control surface (e.g. a diffuser or collar) and is balanced by a force on the primary jet conduit. For a given synthetic jet strength and primary jet speed, the vectoring force depends mainly on the volume flow rate of primary jet fluid that is diverted into the synthetic jet actuator. This flow rate is regulated by restricting the flow of entrained ambient fluid using a small streamwise extension of the synthetic jet orifice that scales with the orifice width. The response of the primary jet to the imposed vectoring is investigated using stepped modulation of the driving signal. The characteristic vectoring time and vectoring angle decrease monotonically with primary jet speed.','2002','empty','August','458','Smith B.

'The formation, evolution, and interactions of a closely spaced pair of coflowing rectangular synthetic jets are investigated using particle image velocimetry. The dynamics of the combined jet is determined by the interactions of the counter-rotating vortex pairs that form each jet. These vortex pairs are formed along the long edges of the orifice of each jet by the time-periodic motion of a diaphragm that is mounted in a cavity underneath the orifice plate and is driven at resonance. It is shown that the phase between the actuation waveforms of the adjacent jets affects the relative timing between their blowing and suction strokes and consequently the formation of the vortex pairs that synthesize each of the jets. These phase variations also lead to controlled vectoring or bending of the combined jet toward the orifice of the jet that is leading in phase and can be varied dynamically on time scales that correspond to the actuation period.','2005','10','October','43','Smith B.

Presented in this paper are results of wind speeds affected by a number of parameters such as the spatial density of street blocks, the building height over surroundings, the relative location of buildings and the direction of approaching wind. Based on literature information and current findings, some generic models have been established with the empirical relations between wind conditions and building configurations.

'High concentrations of car-exhaust gases in urban street canyons are typically associated with low wind velocities or situations when the wind blows perpendicular to the canyon axis. The latter flow configuration has been studied in a wind tunnel model of a street canyon. The mean flow and turbulence structure have both been investigated and comparisons have been carried out with results of full-scale flow measurements in urban street canyons. A qualitative similarity has been found between the results of atmospheric measurements and flow characteristics in the modelled street canyon. Data from all employed sources give evidence of a flow acceleration (in some cases, rather sharp) above roof level. Additionally, the effects of traffic on the organised and turbulent components of airflow in the canyon have been quantified. The experimental data show significant differences in flow and turbulence patterns corresponding to the model cases of one-way and two-way traffic.','2001','empty','empty','89','Kastner-Kein P., Fedorovich E., Rotach M.

'Understanding and controlling the dispersion of pollutants and contaminants in urban areas has become a major concern in the last decade. This study addresses the need for a better understanding of the dynamics involved in the flow field around complex geometries and the need for novel techniques to sense and predict its temporal evolution. Experimentally, it is not possible yet to track the temporal evolution of three dimensional structures in turbulent flows at high Reynolds number and with good spatial resolution. Typically, sparse measurements are used in wind forecasting models for updating and prediction via variational data assimila- tion. To improve upon this method, an experimental investigation combining Particle Image Velocimetry and Static Pressure measurements is carried out to study the airflow around wall mounted obstacles in a turbu- lent boundary-layer. A companion study is performed on a Large Eddy Simulation of the flow around a wall mounted cube in a channel which provides complementary information. The method of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is used to obtain a reduced order representation of the flow field and is used in the construction of indirect measurement models based on sparse measurements from wall pressure sensors. Ultimately the combination of these with state-space models should provide more robust dynamical models.','2010','empty','28 June - 1 July','empty','Monnier B., Mokhasi P., Wark C., ','buildings, winds, decomposition, modeling, urban canyon, flows, aero, reduced order model','Papers/Winds_Around_Buildings/AIAA-2010-4262.pdf','empty','40th Fluid Dynamics Conference and Exhibit.

'A physical method to alter the trajectory of a projectile is a critical element of any smart weapon. Creation of an appropriate control mechanism is often one of the more difficult parts of the overall design due to size, durability, and control authority requirements. The work reported here considers a vibrating internal mass control mechanism applicable to both fin- and spin-stabilized configurations. To investigate the potential of this control mechanism, a 7- degree-of-freedom flight dynamic model of a projectile equipped with an internal translating mass is generated. By vibrating the internal translating mass normal to the axis of symmetry and at the roll rate frequency, significant control authority can be attained with a relatively small internal mass on the order of a percent or so of the total projectile mass. Interestingly, control authority increases proportionally with increasing roll rate and also with increasing station-line cavity offset from the mass center. Trajectory changes are not caused by lateral mass center offset and drag but rather by dynamic coupling between internal mass vibration and the projectile body.','2008','5','September-October','31','Rogers J., Costello M.,','projectile, translating mass, rockets, smart weapon, control, mechanism','Papers/Projectiles/AIAA-33961-733.pdf','empty','Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics','Control Authority of a Projectile Equipped with a Controllable Internal Translating Mass','RogerCostello2008','article','67',
'Internal masses that undergo controlled translation within a projectile have been shown to be effective control mechanisms for smart weapons. However, internal mass oscillation must occur at the projectile roll frequency to generate sufficient control force. This can lead to high power requirements and place a heavy burden on designers attempting to allocate volume within the projectile for internal mass actuators and power supplies. The work reported here outlines a conceptual design for an internal translating mass system using a cantilever beam and electromagnetic actuators. The cantilever beam acts as the moving mass, vibrating at the projectile roll frequency to generate control force. First, a dynamic model is developed to describe the system. Then the natural frequency, damping ratio, and length of the beam are varied to study their affects on force required and total battery size. Trade studies also examine the effect on force required and total battery size of a roll-rate feedback system that actively changes beam elastic properties. Results show that, with proper sizing and specifications, the cantilever beam control mechanism re- quires relatively small batteries and low actuator control forces with minimum actuator complexity and space requirements.','2009','empty','September','131','Rogers J., Costello M.,','cantilever beam, internal mass, projectiles, smart weapons, rockets, control','Papers/Projectiles/DS-08-1315.pdf','empty','Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control','Cantilever Beam Design for Projectile Internal Moving Mass Systems','RogersCostello2009','article','68',
'It is well known that projectiles equipped with liquid payloads experience large destabilizing moments induced by internal motion of the fluid. For some configurations, these moments may lead to catastrophic flight instabilities. This paper explores how payload geometry, fluid spin-up rate, and the magnitude of launch perturbations affect the flight trajectories of projectiles with a liquid payload, including projectile instability. A dynamic simulation model is used in which a projectile rigid-body dynamics representation incorporates liquid moments generated from linearized NavierStokes predictions. A novel feature of this simulation is its use of linear filtering within the model, which determines fast- and slow-mode angle-of-attack contributions at each time step to be used in computation of liquid moments. Example cases and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate how design factors and launch perturbations affect the projectiles tendency to exhibit flight instability. The paper concludes with a summary of advantageous design characteristics that are likely to mitigate the effects of destabilizing liquid moments.','2013','1','January-February','50','Rogers J., Costello M., Cooper G., ','smart weapons, projectiles, rockets, control, sloshing, liquid payload','Papers/Projectiles/JSR_Liquid_Payload_Projectile.pdf','empty','Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets','Design Considerations for Stability of Liquid Payload Projectiles','RogersCostello2013','article','69',
'Non-powered flight vehicles such as kites can provide a means of transmitting wind energy from higher altitudes to the ground via tethers. At Delft University of Technology, construction and testing of such a high altitude wind machine is ongoing. The concept is called the Laddermill. It generates energy by pulling a line under high tension from a drum with a kite and retrieving it under low tension. The change in tension is achieved by changing the angle of attack and flight pattern of the kite. Although there is increased world wide interest for systems to extract wind energy from higher altitudes with kites, research into kite properties is limited. Such research however is required to enable the design of purpose-built kites for energy extraction. This paper presents testing of surf kites that was performed for model validation. Various models are discussed: a point model, a flexible multi-plate model and a rigid-body arc shaped model. Mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of the kite based on test data are presented.','2008','empty','18-21 August','empty','Williams P., Lansdorp B., Ruiterkamp R., Ockels W., ','simulation, parafoil, kite, stability, tethered, tether, towed','Papers/Parafoil_Papers/KiteTestingFinal.pdf','empty','AIAA Modeling and Simulation Technologies Conference and Exhibition','Modeling, Simulation and Testing of Surf Kites for Power Generation','Williams2008','conference','70',
