\subsection{Computers}

Students are expected have a basic understanding of their
computer. For example, they should be able to logon to
Sakai(https://ecampus.southalabama.edu), navigate to assignments and
download their assignment. Most operating systems will download this
file to either the Downloads folder or the Desktop. I encourage all
students to create a folder title ME228 with all pertinent documents
inside. Each assignment must be completed in MATLAB however all text
and figures must be placed into a WORD document. The document must the
be converted to a PDF by clicking File$>$Save\&Send$>$Create PDF
Document$>$Create PDF. Once your document is converted to a PDF you
must upload your document to a PDF. Obviously having a WORD processor
and MATLAB on your computer is required for this course.\\
