\subsection{Example Problems}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a MATLAB code that computes the inverse of a matrix using
  gaussian elimination. Your function header should look like this 

\textcolor{blue}{function} invA = myinv(A)

where A is your input matrix of any size. Test it with three random
matrices. Provide the answer in your assignment. You may not use
inv(),rref() or \textrm{\^}(-1). You may use the eye() function to
create the identity matrix. In your function check that the
determinant of the matrix is not equal to zero using the det()
function. If the determinant is equal to zero return a matrix of zeros
and display 'The inverse of the matrix is undefined'.

\item Using your inverse routine from above write a routine that will
  solve a system of equations. For example, use it to solve the system
  of equations below.

\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}
2u + v = -3 \\
u - 5v = 2
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}

Come up with two more random systems of equations including one with
three variables (u,v and w) and use your routine to solve it. All
system of equations can be written in the form

\begin{equation}
A \vec{x} = \vec{b}
\end{equation}

Using the form above your function header should look like the
following header.

\textcolor{blue}{function} x = my\_sys\_solve(A,b)

\end{enumerate}
