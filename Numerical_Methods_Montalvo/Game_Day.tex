\section{GAME DAY!!}

Class Breaks into Groups. Winning group gets a prize

\begin{enumerate}

\item Answer the following questions. You only have 2 minutes to write as
many as possible

\begin{enumerate} 
  \item Name as many famous mathematicians as you can
  \item Name as many physicists as you can
  \item Name as many philosophers as you can
  \item Name as many programming languages as you can
  \item Name as many transcendental functions as you can
  \item Name as many solids and shapes as you can
\end{enumerate}

\item MATLAB Jeopardy. Students stay in their groups and they have to try
  and answer the questions I have in a PDF. Examples
  include adding all the primes from 1 to 1000 or computing your age
  in days accounting for leap year. I have a text file showing
  different questions for them to complete. Each problem must be
  completed using MATLAB. Each problem can be solved with 5 lines of
  code or less.

\end{enumerate}
