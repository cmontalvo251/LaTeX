soul.sty
========

This article describes the `soul' package, which
provides hyphenatable letterspacing (spacing out),
underlining, and some derivatives.
All features are based upon a common mechanism 
that allows to typeset text syllable by syllable,
where the excellent TeX hyphenation algorithm is
used to find the proper hyphenation points.
Two examples show how to use the provided interface to
implement things such as `an-a-lyz-ing syl-la-bles'.
Although the package is optimized for LaTeX2e,
it works with Plain TeX and with other
packages, too.

Extracting the package & processing the documentation
=====================================================

on Unix/Linux just run "make" to get the style file and the documentation;
else generate the driver soul.ins (if you don't already have it):

    $ latex soul.dtx

You'll probably get an error message that you may ignore. Now generate
the style file:

    $ tex soul.ins

And finally to produce the documentation run LaTeX three times:

    $ latex soul.dtx
