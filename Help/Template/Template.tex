\documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{amsart}  %always need this. this mean that the document will be an asmart 
%with a base font size of 11pt (other examples include , article,report, and book)
%the base fonts that can be used are 10-12pt font. letterpaper sets the page size
%\usepackage{aiaa-tc}                % See geometry.pdf to learn the layout options. There are lots.
%\geometry{letterpaper}                   % ... or a4paper or a5paper or ... 
%\geometry{landscape}                % Activate for for rotated page geometry
\usepackage[parfill]{parskip}   %use this to allow paragraph starts with just a blank line

%%%%%BEGIN PAPER%%%%%

\title{The Title goes here}
\author{and my name goes here}

\begin{document} %start the body of the text
\thispagestyle{plain} %change just this page

%Insert table of contents
\maketitle  %use this to actually display the title and author

\tableofcontents

\section{First Section}

Ok LaTex Tutorial here we go. To type just type. For a new paragraph just make a blank line.

See?

Non-printing character do weird things but a slash \textbackslash will help like this \#

For example we could do this... \TeX or we would do this... \TeX{}which creates space \\ Note that double slash makes new line.

If you want the date just type \today

Some more commands need parameters. Like \textsl{this}  for italics.

Clearly you see that %fkdls;fjdkls;ajkdls;% is a comment.

Oops it commented the whole line!

\section{Some stuff}
blah blah
\section{some more stuff}
\ldots{} and here it ends

\end{document}  

%%%%%%%%%%END OF PAPER%%%%%

So I can put whatever I want here and nothing will show up.

Just to note the commands that the Typeset buttons executes are

latex Template.tex
dvipdf Template.dvi
open Template.pdf

I created a script in this Dropbox/Blackbox called tex2pdf
