This is the file `NEWS', which is part of the `aiaa' distribution.

v3.7 (07-jun-2004)

     to provide a more readable version to use for handouts during
     the oral presentation, added `handcarry' option to the technical
     conference paper class.

     to make it more apparent that the advanced LaTeX sample is not
     for beginners, `template_basic' was renamed `template' and
     `template_advanced' was renamed `advanced_example'.

     added files: NEWS, MANIFEST, COPYING
