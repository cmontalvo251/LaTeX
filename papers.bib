abstract = {Conceptual work on tangible interfaces has focused primarily on the production of descriptive frameworks. While this work has been successful in mapping out a space of technical possibilities and providing a terminology to ground discussion, it provides little guidance on the cognitive or social effects of using one type of interface or another. In this paper we look at the area of learning with tangible interfaces, suggesting that more empirically grounded research is needed to guide development. We provide an analytic framework of six perspectives, which describes latent trends and assumptions that might be used to motivate and guide this work, and makes links with existing research in cognitive science and education.},

abstract="We describe and compare the programming languages C, MATLAB and Python as teaching languages for engineering students. We distinguish between two distinct phases in the process of converting a given problem into a computer program that can provide a solution: (i) finding an algorithmic solution and (ii) implementing this in a particular programming language. It is argued that it is most important for the understanding of the students to perform the first step whereas the actual implementation in a programming language is of secondary importance for the learning of problem-solving techniques. We therefore suggest to chose a well-structured teaching language that provides a clear and intuitive syntax and allows students to quickly express their algorithms. In our experience in engineering computing we find that MATLAB is much better suited than C for this task but the best choice in terms of clarity and functionality of the language is provided by Python.",

abstract = {Abstract The function of the engineering profession is to manipulate materials, energy, and information, thereby creating benefit for humankind. To do this successfully, engineers must have a knowledge of nature that goes beyond mere theory—knowledge that is traditionally gained in educational laboratories. Over the years, however, the nature of these laboratories has changed. This paper describes the history of some of these changes and explores in some depth a few of the major factors influencing laboratories today. In particular, the paper considers the lack of coherent learning objectives for laboratories and how this lack has limited the effectiveness of laboratories and hampered meaningful research in the area. A list of fundamental objectives is presented along with suggestions for possible future research.},

abstract = {The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in August last year is designed to study the chemical and isotopic composition of the martian atmosphere. Mahaffy et al. (p. 263) present volume-mixing ratios of Mars{\textquoteright} five major atmospheric constituents (CO2, Ar, N2, O2, and CO) and isotope measurements of 40Ar/36Ar and C and O in CO2, based on data from one of SAM{\textquoteright}s instruments, obtained between 31 August and 21 November 2012. Webster et al. (p. 260) used data from another of SAM{\textquoteright}s instruments obtained around the same period to determine isotope ratios of H, C, and O in atmospheric CO2 and H2O. Agreement between the isotopic ratios measured by SAM with those of martian meteorites, measured in laboratories on Earth, confirms the origin of these meteorites and implies that the current atmospheric reservoirs of CO2 and H2O were largely established after the period of early atmospheric loss some 4 billion years ago. Volume mixing and isotope ratios secured with repeated atmospheric measurements taken with the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite on the Curiosity rover are: carbon dioxide (CO2), 0.960({\textpm}0.007); argon-40 (40Ar), 0.0193({\textpm}0.0001); nitrogen (N2), 0.0189({\textpm}0.0003); oxygen, 1.45({\textpm}0.09) {\texttimes} 10-3; carbon monoxide, \&lt; 1.0 {\texttimes} 10-3; and 40Ar/36Ar, 1.9({\textpm}0.3) {\texttimes} 103. The 40Ar/N2 ratio is 1.7 times greater and the 40Ar/36Ar ratio 1.6 times lower than values reported by the Viking Lander mass spectrometer in 1976, whereas other values are generally consistent with Viking and remote sensing observations. The 40Ar/36Ar ratio is consistent with martian meteoritic values, which provides additional strong support for a martian origin of these rocks. The isotopic signature δ13C from CO2 of ~45 per mil is independently measured with two instruments. This heavy isotope enrichment in carbon supports the hypothesis of substantial atmospheric loss.},

abstract = {We deal here primarily with the surface meteorological data for both Viking landers during the nominal missions (44 sols for lander 1 and 61 sols for lander 2). The diurnal patterns of wind, temperature, and pressure were strongly similar from sol to sol, as was expected in the summer. The chief characteristics of the wind data are that winds were light (a few meters per second), with a complex hodograph at VL-1 dominated by counterclockwise turning of the wind and a simpler hodograph at VL-2 marked by clockwise turning of the wind. This repetitive pattern of wind has begun to break down at VL-2 with advancing season, and several episodes of protracted northeasterly winds have occurred. Some of these are associated with lower than normal temperatures. Examples are given of wind and temperature traces over short periods, illustrating the effects of convection, static stability, and lander interference. We present a theoretical argument based upon the horizontal scale dictated by heating of slopes and upon vertical mixing of momentum to explain the different sense of rotation of the wind vectors at the two sites. Analysis of the semidiurnal pressure oscillation suggests that absorption of solar radiation is an important thermal drive but that convective heat flux from the surface is also significant. The seasonal variation of pressure extending past the end of the nominal missions shows a decrease of pressure to a minimum at Ls ≈ 149° with a rapid rise thereafter. This is clearly due to condensation and sublimation of CO2 on and from the southern polar cap.},

abstract = {Magnetic-field power spectra computed from data obtained with the Mariner 4 spacecraft are analyzed to determine the cosmic-ray diffusion tensor in interplanetary space. The diffusion tensor is computed for particles with rigidities R = Pc/z from 0.1 to 10 Gv, for two heliocentric ranges, one near the orbit of earth and the other near the orbit of Mars. At rigidities ≲ 1 Gv, the parallel diffusion coefficient is approximately K∥ ∼ 5 × 1021 R1/2β cm² sec−1 at ∼ 1 AU. It is smaller at r ∼ 1.5 AU. The computed diffusion tensor leads to a cosmic-ray gradient as a function of rigidity that is consistent with the gradient determined from cosmic-ray data by O'Gallagher and Simpson. Finally, cross correlation of the cosmic-ray counting rate with the level of magnetic fluctuations (amplitude of the power spectrum) shows that the periods of high field variance are followed by depressed counting rates.},

abstract = {This research article presents the architecture analysis and design of Attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS) of the Pico-Satellites especially the CubeSat, developed and launched into the Low Earth orbit (LEO). ADCS is not a stringent requirement for all the CubeSat missions but several missions were specifically designed to test and validate the ADCS. This paper contributes in evaluating the previous ADCS of CubeSat and presents an optimal ADCS design and a recipe for any CubeSat mission and specifically for the upcoming ICUBE of the Institute of Space Technology (IST), Pakistan. The proposed ADCS for ICUBE includes GPS receiver as position sensor while magnetometer as attitude sensor and magnetic coils as the active actuators. The determination will be done by Kalman filter and LQR will be used as a controller.},

Results compare satisfactorily with those reported in the existing literature. Non-separability of the correlation functions is a pervasive feature. Accounting for non-separability in 3D-Var is necessary to reproduce geostrophic characteristics of the statistics, such as the increase of length-scale with height for the horizontal correlation of the mass variable, sharper vertical correlations for wind than for mass and shorter horizontal length-scales for temperature than for mass. In our non-separable 3D-Var, the vertical correlations vary with total wave-number and the horizontal correlation functions vary with vertical level.},

%description = {The construction of a building inevitably changes the microclimate in its vicinity. In particular near high-rise buildings, high wind velocities are often introduced at pedestrian level that can be experienced as uncomfortable or even dangerous. Therefore, the design of a building should not only focus on the building envelope and on providing good indoor environment, but should also include the effect of the design on the outdoor environment. The outdoor environment of a building, in particular related to wind, has received relatively little attention in the Building Physics community. The present paper addresses Building Physicists and focuses on the outdoor wind environment for pedestrians. First, a litera- ture review on pedestrian wind studies is provided. The relation between wind effects, wind comfort, wind danger and wind climate is outlined. A brief review on wind tunnel and numerical modeling of building aerodynamics and pedestrian wind is given. The typical wind flow pattern around buildings and the related wind environment at pedestrian level are discussed. Second, these problems are illustrated by means of four practical examples, where the unfavorable pedestrian wind environment has been, is or should be a matter of serious concern for the building designers and the building owner.},

%description = {A numerical investigation of active flow control, which can offer significant improvements to aircraft wing, helicopter and wind-turbine rotor performance by suppressing detrimental effects of separated flow, is presented. Numerical simulations of pulsating jet flow control applied on airfoils and wings at low speed, high Reynolds number turbulent flow and fixed angles of incidence are carried out. Pulsating jet active flow control is applied as a surface boundary condition and the flow is time-dependent. It was found that fine grid resolution is required to capture the pulsating jet and its interaction with the boundary layer. Efficient, implicit, time-accurate numerical methods for unsteady RANS of incompressible flow are used to overcome the stringent stability limitations imposed by small grid spacing. A widely tested one-equation turbulence model is used for the prediction of the complex, unsteady flowfields. It is found that active flow control can enhance aerodynamic performance by reducing the adverse effects of separated flow. The effect of pulsation frequency, and jet exit velocity on flow control is investigated.},

%description = {The interaction between a conventional rectangular (primary) air jet and a co-flowing synthetic jet is investigated experimentally. The nozzles of both jets have the same long dimension but the aspect ratio of the synthetic jet orifice is 25 times larger. Detailed particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the flow in the midspan plane show that primary jet fluid is directed into the synthetic jet orifice and the interaction between the jets leads to the formation of a closed recirculating flow domain. The concomitant formation of a low-pressure region between the jets results in deflection of the primary jet toward the actuator jet despite the absence of an extended control surface (e.g. a diffuser or collar) and is balanced by a force on the primary jet conduit. For a given synthetic jet strength and primary jet speed, the vectoring force depends mainly on the volume flow rate of primary jet fluid that is diverted into the synthetic jet actuator. This flow rate is regulated by restricting the flow of entrained ambient fluid using a small streamwise extension of the synthetic jet orifice that scales with the orifice width. The response of the primary jet to the imposed vectoring is investigated using stepped modulation of the driving signal. The characteristic vectoring time and vectoring angle decrease monotonically with primary jet speed.},

The dynamics of the combined jet is determined by the interactions of the counter-rotating vortex pairs that form each jet. These vortex pairs are formed along the long edges of the orifice of each jet by the time-periodic motion of a diaphragm that is mounted in a cavity underneath the orifice plate and is driven at resonance. It is shown that the phase between the actuation waveforms of the adjacent jets affects the relative timing between their blowing and suction strokes and consequently the formation of the vortex pairs that synthesize each of the jets. These phase variations also lead to controlled vectoring or bending of the combined jet toward the orifice of the jet that is leading in phase and can be varied dynamically on time scales that correspond to the actuation period.},

The mean flow and turbulence structure have both been investigated and comparisons have been carried out with results of full-scale flow measurements in urban street canyons. A qualitative similarity has been found between the results of atmospheric measurements and flow characteristics in the modelled street canyon. Data from all employed sources give evidence of a flow acceleration (in some cases, rather sharp) above roof level. Additionally, the effects of traffic on the organised and turbulent components of airflow in the canyon have been quantified. The experimental data show significant differences in flow and turbulence patterns corresponding to the model cases of one-way and two-way traffic.},

This study addresses the need for a better understanding of the dynamics involved in the flow field around complex geometries and the need for novel techniques to sense and predict its temporal evolution. Experimentally, it is not possible yet to track the temporal evolution of three dimensional structures in turbulent flows at high Reynolds number and with good spatial resolution. Typically, sparse measurements are used in wind forecasting models for updating and prediction via variational data assimila- tion. To improve upon this method, an experimental investigation combining Particle Image Velocimetry and Static Pressure measurements is carried out to study the airflow around wall mounted obstacles in a turbu- lent boundary-layer. A companion study is performed on a Large Eddy Simulation of the flow around a wall mounted cube in a channel which provides complementary information. The method of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is used to obtain a reduced order representation of the flow field and is used in the construction of indirect measurement models based on sparse measurements from wall pressure sensors. Ultimately the combination of these with state-space models should provide more robust dynamical models.},

Creation of an appropriate control mechanism is often one of the more difficult parts of the overall design due to size, durability, and control authority requirements. The work reported here considers a vibrating internal mass control mechanism applicable to both fin- and spin-stabilized configurations. To investigate the potential of this control mechanism, a 7- degree-of-freedom flight dynamic model of a projectile equipped with an internal translating mass is generated. By vibrating the internal translating mass normal to the axis of symmetry and at the roll rate frequency, significant control authority can be attained with a relatively small internal mass on the order of a percent or so of the total projectile mass. Interestingly, control authority increases proportionally with increasing roll rate and also with increasing station-line cavity offset from the mass center. Trajectory changes are not caused by lateral mass center offset and drag but rather by dynamic coupling between internal mass vibration and the projectile body.},

%description = {Internal masses that undergo controlled translation within a projectile have been shown to be effective control mechanisms for smart weapons. However, internal mass oscillation must occur at the projectile roll frequency to generate sufficient control force. This can lead to high power requirements and place a heavy burden on designers attempting to allocate volume within the projectile for internal mass actuators and power supplies. The work reported here outlines a conceptual design for an internal translating mass system using a cantilever beam and electromagnetic actuators. The cantilever beam acts as the moving mass, vibrating at the projectile roll frequency to generate control force. First, a dynamic model is developed to describe the system. Then the natural frequency, damping ratio, and length of the beam are varied to study their affects on force required and total battery size. Trade studies also examine the effect on force required and total battery size of a roll-rate feedback system that actively changes beam elastic properties. Results show that, with proper sizing and specifications, the cantilever beam control mechanism re- quires relatively small batteries and low actuator control forces with minimum actuator complexity and space requirements.},

For some configurations, these moments may lead to catastrophic flight instabilities. This paper explores how payload geometry, fluid spin-up rate, and the magnitude of launch perturbations affect the flight trajectories of projectiles with a liquid payload, including projectile instability. A dynamic simulation model is used in which a projectile rigid-body dynamics representation incorporates liquid moments generated from linearized NavierStokes predictions. A novel feature of this simulation is its use of linear filtering within the model, which determines fast- and slow-mode angle-of-attack contributions at each time step to be used in computation of liquid moments. Example cases and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate how design factors and launch perturbations affect the projectiles tendency to exhibit flight instability. The paper concludes with a summary of advantageous design characteristics that are likely to mitigate the effects of destabilizing liquid moments.},

At Delft University of Technology, construction and testing of such a high altitude wind machine is ongoing. The concept is called the Laddermill. It generates energy by pulling a line under high tension from a drum with a kite and retrieving it under low tension. The change in tension is achieved by changing the angle of attack and flight pattern of the kite. Although there is increased world wide interest for systems to extract wind energy from higher altitudes with kites, research into kite properties is limited. Such research however is required to enable the design of purpose-built kites for energy extraction. This paper presents testing of surf kites that was performed for model validation. Various models are discussed: a point model, a flexible multi-plate model and a rigid-body arc shaped model. Mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of the kite based on test data are presented.},

abstract = {We derived a coordinate-free form of equations of motion for a complete model of a quadrotor UAV with a payload which is connected via a flexible cable according to Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold. The flexible cable is modeled as a system of serially-connected links and has been considered in the full dynamic model. A geometric nonlinear control system is presented to asymptotically stabilize the position of the quadrotor while aligning the links to the vertical direction below the quadrotor. Numerical simulation and experimental results are presented and a rigorous stability analysis is provided to confirm the accuracy of our derivations. These results will be particularly useful for aggressive load transportation that involves large deformation of the cable.},
